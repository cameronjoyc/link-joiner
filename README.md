# rat / logger?
Is this a rat / logger?
Im not to familiar with this and im unsure why it gets a 7/10.

you can upload the file to triage yourself right now its only a 7/10 on triage because of aiohttp connections ( this is what i think anyway ).

# how to use it
Simple input your token and then the channel id of the channel you want to listen for links in.

on a good pc takes 3 seconds to join a game.

mid pc around 5-7 seconds.

I myself made it in both na - west and na - east servers doing this 

# cool stuff
only clicks new links that are newly sent ( from when you start the tool )
doesnt double click the same link.
